# AirAsiaAcademy
In September 2022, I attended the AirAsia Acdemy Data Analytics bootcamp, a 10 day where I learned how to perform data analysis in both R and Python. My time there was enjoyable; while my degree was in Statistical Data Science, I enjoyed the opportunity to refresh my skills in these languages and help out my peers, many of whom did not come from a coding background. It was a very insightful experience overall, and one I cherish for the memories and good times.

Below are some of the projects I worked on during my bootcamp. 

- [Mini PROJECT.R](https://github.com/arissanbahari/AirAsiaAcademy/blob/main/MINI%20PROJECT.R) is the file where I analyse the
  college dataset and include my comments and conclusons.
- [server.R]() and [ui.R]() are my RShiny projects for the same college dataset
